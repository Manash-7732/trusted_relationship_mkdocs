# what is Trusted Relationship between a client(Windows machine) and unix server using PuTTY and SSH key pairs

* A trusted relationship between a Windows client and a Unix server using PuTTY and SSH key pairs refers to an authentication method that eliminates the need for passwords while providing a secure connection.

## Why Use SSH Key Pairs?

* Security: Instead of relying on easily guessable passwords, SSH key pairs use cryptography to ensure only authorized users can access the server. This minimizes the risk of brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.
* Convenience: You don't need to remember and type a password every time you connect. This is especially beneficial for frequent connections and automated tasks.

## How it Works:

* Key Generation: You generate a pair of keys: a private key (kept securely on your Windows machine) and a public key (copied to the authorized users list on the Unix server).
* Connection Request: When you use PuTTY to connect to the server, it sends your public key along with the connection request.
* Authentication: The server checks if the public key matches one in its authorized users list. If it does, the connection is established without needing a password.
# Benefits of a Trusted Relationship:

* Enhanced Security: Eliminates password vulnerabilities and adds stronger authentication.
* Convenience: Avoids frequent password typing and allows seamless connections.
* Automation: Enables secure automated tasks without manual intervention.

# Important Note:

* Securely keep your private key file as it grants access to the server. If compromised, someone could impersonate you.
* Consider different key types and passphrase strengths based on your security needs and risk tolerance.
I hope this explanation clarifies the concept of a trusted relationship using PuTTY and SSH key pairs!
